# Miscellaneous Documentation

This file is for:
- Put documentation that we are still not sure where to place it in here... but we want to keep track of that docs...

# Initial set-up
- To setup PyPI we follow [this docs](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/). The process is straightforward, no need of anything else.
- To setup JIRA/Github we install [this tool](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/integrate-with-github/). The installation is straightforward, no need of anything else.
- We used and test [Smart Commits](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/process-issues-with-smart-commits/). Important, for Smart Commits to work, the commiter's email is to be a valid JIRA user's email.
