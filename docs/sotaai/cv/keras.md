# Keras object description

The `load_model` and `load_dataset` functions in the `keras_wrapper.py`
submodule return a specific type of objects. Here's the descprition for both.

## Datasets

...

```python
def load_dataset(params...) -> dict:
    """Description..."""
    ...
    return dataset
```

The possible keywords within the dataset dictionary are:

- `...`

...

### Unit Testing

- Assert that the object being returned is of type `dict`.
- Assert that each split is of type
  `...`.
